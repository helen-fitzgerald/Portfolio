# Data Analyst, Berlin, DE

## About Me
I'm a data analyst with a background in communications, business development, and marketing. As I have often collaborated with and depended upon data analysts in my previous roles, I offer the unique perspective of interpreting the needs of those who otherwise cannot articulate their analytical needs. 

My work experience spans a diverse range of industries including technology, finance, education, creative arts, and healthcare - all of which have highlighted the adaptability and flexibility of my skill set.

I am currently seeking new opportunities to work with a team of equally passionate individuals where I can apply and expand my expertise.

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, Tableau, PowerBI, MS Excel, Google Sheets
